## Graph traversal

<div style="text-align: justify">
    Graph traversal is a fundamental operation in graph data structures, where it involves visiting all the nodes (vertices) and edges of a graph in a systematic way. In simple terms, it means exploring the entire graph to perform specific tasks, such as searching for a particular node, checking connectivity, finding paths, or processing nodes in a specific order.

##### Graph traversal algorithms can broadly be classified into two main categories: depth-first traversal and breadth-first traversal.

1. **Depth-First Traversal (DFS):**
   Depth-First Traversal explores as far as possible along each branch before backtracking. It starts at a specific node (the source node) and follows a path as deep as possible before backtracking and exploring other branches. It often uses recursion or an explicit stack to keep track of visited nodes and the order of exploration. There are two common variants of DFS:
      a. Recursive DFS: It uses function calls to traverse the graph recursively.
      b. Iterative DFS: It uses an explicit stack to simulate recursion without function calls.

2. **Breadth-First Traversal (BFS):**
   Breadth-First Traversal explores all the neighboring nodes of a given depth (level) before moving on to nodes at the next depth. It starts at the source node and explores all nodes at a given distance (level) from the source before moving to nodes farther away. It typically uses a queue data structure to maintain the order of exploration.

Graph traversal is essential for various applications, such as finding paths, cycle detection, connected components, shortest paths, network analysis, and many other graph-related problems.


The efficiency of graph traversal algorithms can vary depending on the graph's size, density, and representation. For example, adjacency lists are often preferred for sparse graphs, while adjacency matrices can be more efficient for dense graphs. Choosing the right traversal algorithm and representation can significantly impact the performance of graph-related tasks.
