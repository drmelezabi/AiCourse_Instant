## Semi structured database

A semi-structured database is a type of database that does not adhere to the strict tabular structure of traditional relational databases, yet it also has some level of structure and organization. In a semi-structured database, data can be stored in various formats, such as JSON (JavaScript Object Notation), XML (eXtensible Markup Language), key-value pairs, nested documents, and more. This allows for more flexibility in how data is stored, making it suitable for scenarios where data structures may evolve over time or where data is heterogeneous and doesn't fit neatly into tables.

Key characteristics of semi-structured databases include:

1. **Schema Flexibility**: Unlike traditional relational databases that require a fixed schema defined in advance, semi-structured databases allow for more dynamic and adaptable schema. New attributes or fields can be added to the data without needing to modify the entire database structure.

2. **Hierarchical Data**: Semi-structured databases can handle hierarchical or nested data structures, where elements can contain other elements in a tree-like fashion. This is particularly useful for representing complex data relationships.

3. **Variety of Data Formats**: Data in a semi-structured database can be stored in various formats like JSON, XML, BSON (Binary JSON), etc. This variety supports diverse data types and structures.

4. **Partial Data**: It's possible to have missing or incomplete data for certain attributes, and the database can still manage and process such data.

5. **Query Flexibility**: Querying semi-structured data can be more flexible since it doesn't require adhering to a rigid schema. This can be advantageous when dealing with evolving or heterogeneous data.

6. **Scalability**: Semi-structured databases can handle large amounts of data and are often designed to scale horizontally, making them suitable for applications with rapidly growing datasets.

7. **Document-Oriented**: In many cases, semi-structured databases are document-oriented, meaning that data is stored in documents (e.g., JSON documents) instead of rows in tables.

8. **Examples**: Some popular examples of semi-structured databases include MongoDB (document-oriented), Couchbase, Cassandra, and DynamoDB. These databases are often used in modern web applications, content management systems, IoT (Internet of Things) platforms, and other scenarios where data structures may change frequently.

It's important to note that while semi-structured databases offer more flexibility compared to traditional relational databases, they might require careful design and consideration of data access patterns to ensure efficient querying and data management. The choice between a semi-structured database and a traditional relational database depends on the specific requirements and nature of the data being stored and accessed.
