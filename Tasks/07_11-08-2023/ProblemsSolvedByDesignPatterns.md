## common problem that design pattern aim to solve

**1. Inflexible Class Structures:**

- Problem: Hard to modify or extend existing classes without affecting the entire system.
- Solution (Design Patterns):
  - Decorator Pattern: Allows adding new functionality to objects dynamically.
  - Adapter Pattern: Makes incompatible interfaces work together.
  - Composite Pattern: Enables treating individual objects and compositions uniformly.

**2. Coupled Components:**

- Problem: Changes in one part of the system cause ripple effects in other parts.
- Solution (Design Patterns):
  - Observer Pattern: Maintains loose coupling between objects that need to be notified of changes.
  - Mediator Pattern: Reduces direct dependencies by centralizing communication between components.

**3. Object Creation Complexity:**

- Problem: Creating objects involves complex initialization steps or dependencies.
- Solution (Design Patterns):
  - Factory Method Pattern: Provides an interface for creating objects, hiding the details of instantiation.
  - Abstract Factory Pattern: Creates families of related objects without specifying concrete classes.
  - Builder Pattern: Separates the construction of complex objects from their representation.

**4. Inefficient Resource Utilization:**

- Problem: Poor use of system resources, especially in multi-threaded environments.
- Solution (Design Patterns):
  - Singleton Pattern: Ensures a single instance of a class for shared resource management.
  - Object Pool Pattern: Reuses and manages a pool of objects to reduce resource allocation overhead.

**5. Lack of Flexibility in Algorithm Selection:**

- Problem: Need to switch between different algorithms or strategies.
- Solution (Design Patterns):
  - Strategy Pattern: Defines a family of interchangeable algorithms and encapsulates them.
  - Template Method Pattern: Defines the structure of an algorithm while allowing specific steps to be overridden.

**6. Unorganized Code and Responsibilities:**

- Problem: Code becomes difficult to understand and maintain as it grows.
- Solution (Design Patterns):
  - MVC (Model-View-Controller) Pattern: Separates concerns in GUI applications (Model for data, View for presentation, Controller for user interaction).
  - MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) Pattern: Enhances MVC for modern UI frameworks by introducing a ViewModel for UI logic.

**7. Poor Data Access and Storage Management:**

- Problem: Direct database access throughout the application leads to maintenance challenges.
- Solution (Design Patterns):
  - Repository Pattern: Abstracts data access and provides a consistent interface for data storage and retrieval.

**8. Code Duplication and Reusability:**

- Problem: Repeating similar code in multiple parts of the application.
- Solution (Design Patterns):
  - Template Method Pattern: Provides a common structure for algorithms, reducing code duplication.
  - Prototype Pattern: Enables object creation by copying existing instances.

**9. Complex System Initialization:**

- Problem: Managing the initialization and configuration of a complex system.
- Solution (Design Patterns):
  - Abstract Factory Pattern: Helps in creating objects of multiple related families, ensuring consistency in initialization.

**10. Handling State Transitions:**

- Problem: Objects need to change behavior based on internal state changes.
- Solution (Design Patterns):
  - State Pattern: Allows an object to change its behavior when its internal state changes.
