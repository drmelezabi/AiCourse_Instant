## Creating Instance

When you create an instance directly, you're making a completely new object from a class. This instance is independent and doesn't share data with other instances of the same class. Each instance has its own memory space and data.

**Example**

```python
class Car:
    def __init__(self, brand):
        self.brand = brand

# Creating instances directly
car1 = Car("Toyota")
car2 = Car("Honda")

print(car1.brand)  # Output: Toyota
print(car2.brand)  # Output: Honda
```

In this case, `car1` and `car2` are separate instances, and each has its own `brand` attribute.

## Prototype Pattern

With the Prototype pattern, you create new objects by copying an existing object (the prototype). This is useful when creating new objects involves complex setup or data, and you want to reuse an existing object's structure and data as a template.

**Example**

```python
import copy

class Shape:
    def clone(self):
        pass

class Circle(Shape):
    def __init__(self):
        self.radius = 0

    def set_radius(self, radius):
        self.radius = radius

    def clone(self):
        return copy.deepcopy(self)

# Creating a prototype circle
circle_prototype = Circle()
circle_prototype.set_radius(5)

# Cloning and customizing prototypes
circle1 = circle_prototype.clone()
circle1.set_radius(8)

circle2 = circle_prototype.clone()
circle2.set_radius(10)

print(circle_prototype.radius)  # Output: 5 (Original prototype remains unchanged)
print(circle1.radius)  # Output: 8
print(circle2.radius)  # Output: 10
```

In this example, we use the Prototype pattern to create new circles based on a prototype. We copy the prototype and then customize each cloned circle by setting its radius. The Prototype pattern helps us avoid repeating the complex setup for creating circles.

### Summary

In summary, the main difference between creating instances directly and using the Prototype pattern lies in how you reuse existing structures and data. Directly creating instances is best for when you want independent objects with unique data. The Prototype pattern is useful when you want to save time by using an existing object's structure as a template and customizing it for new objects.
