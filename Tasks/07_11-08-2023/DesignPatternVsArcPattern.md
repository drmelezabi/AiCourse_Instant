## Design patterns vs. architecture patterns

**Design Patterns:**
Design patterns are reusable solutions to specific recurring problems in software design. They provide guidelines for solving common design issues and promote best practices for writing modular, flexible, and efficient code. Design patterns are typically focused on the micro-level of software design, dealing with classes, objects, and their interactions within a module or component. They help with code organization, improve code reusability, and enhance maintainability.

Some examples of design patterns include the Singleton pattern, Factory pattern, Observer pattern, and Strategy pattern. These patterns provide well-defined solutions to problems like managing object creation, handling asynchronous notifications, and enabling dynamic behavior.

**Architecture Patterns:**
Architecture patterns, on the other hand, deal with high-level structural decisions that shape the entire software system. They provide guidelines for organizing the components and subsystems of a software application, ensuring that the system as a whole is well-organized, scalable, and maintainable. Architecture patterns focus on the macro-level of software design and involve decisions about how different modules and components interact with each other, how data flows through the system, and how different layers are organized.

Examples of architecture patterns include the Model-View-Controller (MVC) pattern, Microservices architecture, Layered architecture, and Event-Driven architecture. These patterns help developers design systems that can handle large-scale complexity, support evolving requirements, and facilitate collaboration among development teams.
