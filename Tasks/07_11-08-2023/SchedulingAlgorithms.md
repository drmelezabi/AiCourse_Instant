## Scheduling algorithms

Scheduling algorithms are a fundamental component of operating systems and are used to manage the allocation of resources, such as CPU time, among competing processes or threads. The choice of scheduling algorithm can have a significant impact on system performance, responsiveness, and fairness. There are several scheduling algorithms, each with its own characteristics and suitable use cases. Here are some common scheduling algorithms and when to use them:

1. **First-Come, First-Served (FCFS)**:

   - In FCFS, processes are executed in the order they arrive.
   - Suitable for batch processing where all processes are submitted at once, and no interactive response is required.
   - Not ideal for interactive systems as it can lead to the "convoy effect" where a short process has to wait behind a long process.

2. **Shortest Job Next (SJN) / Shortest Job First (SJF)**:

   - Selects the process with the smallest execution time next.
   - Suitable for minimizing average waiting time and maximizing throughput.
   - Requires knowledge of the execution time of each process, which may not always be available.

3. **Round Robin (RR)**:

   - Each process is assigned a fixed time slice (quantum) to run before being preempted.
   - Suitable for time-sharing systems and interactive applications as it provides fairness and responsiveness.
   - Can suffer from high context-switching overhead if the time slice is too small.

4. **Priority Scheduling**:

   - Each process is assigned a priority, and the highest priority process is executed next.
   - Suitable for systems with different levels of priority, but it can lead to starvation of low-priority processes.

5. **Multilevel Queue Scheduling**:

   - Divides processes into multiple queues with different priorities.
   - Suitable for systems with distinct classes of processes, like foreground and background tasks.

6. **Multilevel Feedback Queue Scheduling**:

   - Similar to multilevel queue scheduling but allows processes to move between queues based on their behavior.
   - Suitable for handling a mix of short and long processes, adapting to changing workloads.

7. **Priority Inheritance**:

   - Prevents priority inversion by temporarily boosting the priority of a low-priority process that is holding a resource needed by a higher-priority process.
   - Suitable for real-time systems where priority inversion can lead to missed deadlines.

8. **Lottery Scheduling**:

   - Assigns processes "lottery tickets" based on their priority, and a random draw determines which process runs.
   - Suitable for systems where fairness is important, as well as when varying resource allocation is desired.

9. **Earliest Deadline First (EDF)**:
   - Schedules tasks based on their relative deadlines.
   - Suitable for real-time systems where meeting deadlines is crucial.

The choice of scheduling algorithm depends on the specific requirements of the system and the workload it needs to handle. Factors such as response time, throughput, fairness, predictability, and the nature of the tasks being executed all play a role in selecting the most appropriate algorithm. It's important to carefully analyze the characteristics of the system and the workload to make an informed decision about which scheduling algorithm to use.
